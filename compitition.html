<h1 class="tit">some important programming compitions</h1>
<p class="in">A great way to improve your skills when learning to code is by solving coding challenges. Solving different types of challenges and puzzles can help you become a better problem solver, learn the intricacies of a programming language, prepare for job interviews, learn new algorithms, and more.

Below is a list of some popular coding challenge websites with a short description of what each one offers.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>1. TopCoder</h1>
<img class="im" src="s.png">

<p class="p">TopCoder is one of the original platforms for competitive programming online. It provides a list of algorithmic challenges from the past that you can complete on your own directly online using their code editor. Their popular Single Round Matches are offered a few times per month at a specific time where you compete against others to solve challenges the fastest with the best score.

The top ranked users on TopCoder are very good competitive programmers and regularly compete in programming competitions. The top ranked user maintains his own blog titled Algorithms weekly by Petr Mitrichev where he writes about coding competitions, algorithms, math, and more.</p>

<h1>2. Coderbyte</h1>
<img class="im" src="com.png">

<p class="p">Coderbyte provides 200+ coding challenges you can solve directly online in one of 10 programming languages (check out this example). The challenges range from easy (finding the largest word in a string) to hard (print the maximum cardinality matching of a graph).

They also provide a collection of algorithm tutorials, introductory videos, and interview preparation courses. Unlike HackerRank and other similar websites, you are able to view the solutions other users provide for any challenge aside from the official solutions posted by Coderbyte.</p>

<h1>4. HackerRank</h1>
<img class="im" src="h.png">
<p class="p">HackerRank provides challenges for several different domains such as Algorithms, Mathematics, SQL, Functional Programming, AI, and more. You can solve all the challenge directly online (check out this example). They provide a discussion and leaderboard for every challenge, and most challenges come with an editorial that explains more about the challenge and how to approach it to come up with a solution. Aside from the editorial, you cannot currently view the solutions of other users on HackerRank.

HackerRank also provides the ability for users to submit applications and apply to jobs by solving company-sponsored coding challenges.</p>
